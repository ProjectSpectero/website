            <h5>We implement our own techniques to minimize exposure in our daily web scraping activities, but we still get blocked. What can we do about it?</h5>
            <p>Spectero Managed was built to tackle risks associated with data harvesting. IP blocking is just one of them, and even though it's the most common, it's also the easiest to solve. Our intelligent IP rotation algorithm minimizes the risk of IP-based blocking. Even if the IP is blacklisted by mistake, the site is still accessible through our other vastly scattered resources. The system was designed to deliver you the data, no matter what.</p>
